# color-tweening-lua
Part of my Lua Script collection, where I preserve random lua projects I make over time.

- no .rbxl file, this was made in an existing project
- to configure make two intvalues with the name Temperature and OldTemperature, and adjust the debounceTemp and tempValObject value in the script. In the function updateColors, you can do whatever you want.
